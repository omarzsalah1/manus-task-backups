## Key Learnings

1. **Task abandonment** is the primary failure mode - solved by RULE 0 (mandatory registration) and RULE 8 (anti-abandonment)
2. **Parent-child linkage** must be explicit and persistent in Asana Brain
3. **Completion verification** requires checking original scope, not just subtask completion
4. **Real incidents** provide the best protocol improvements - BOOK1 case study now documented
