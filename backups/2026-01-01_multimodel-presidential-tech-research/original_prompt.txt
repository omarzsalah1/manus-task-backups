Perfect! ✅ I've completely revised the research prompt to focus on **esoteric, radical, and little-known technology**.

## 🔬 Key Changes:

### **NEW: "Critical Instruction" Section**
Explicitly tells researchers:
- ❌ DON'T give us "Air Force One has phones" (obvious)
- ✅ DO give us "The NSA-modified BlackBerry with camera removed, model Sectera Edge, AES-256 encryption..."

### **Hyper-Specific Hunts:**

**Eisenhower:** Not "car phone" but exact Motorola model, weight (47 lbs?), VHF frequency, relay system specs, installation cost vs. civilian car prices

**LBJ:** Not "liked phones" but bathroom phone brand, waterproofing, how many buttons on his console, direct dial list by name

**Nixon:** Not "taped conversations" but Sony model numbers (TC-800B?), microphone count/placement, voice-activation trigger specs

**Obama:** Not "kept BlackBerry" but exact modified model (Sectera Edge? Custom RIM 8830?), which features removed, encryption standard, who could contact him (exact number of people)

**Trump:** Which iPhone model, documented security failures, what apps were on it

**Biden:** Peloton modifications required (camera disabled? Air-gapped? Secure room?)

### **New Esoteric Categories:**
- Pneumatic tubes (still operational?)
- The "football" updates by administration
- White House Communications Agency gear (brands, models)
- Failed technology experiments
- Comparison to foreign leaders' tech

### **Opening Example:**
Shows exactly what we want:
> "The Motorola RV-25 weighing forty-seven pounds in the trunk of his Chrysler Imperial, connected via VHF relay to a Pentagon switchboard, allowing John Foster Dulles to interrupt Ike's backswing at Burning Tree with news that Nasser had nationalized the Suez Canal. Installation cost $1,400—roughly what a new Chevrolet cost in 1956."

Not: "Eisenhower had a car phone." 🙄

### **Target Audience:**
- Tech geeks who want model numbers
- Security professionals fascinated by trade-offs
- CEOs who think they know executive productivity
- Anyone who wants to say "I had NO idea"

This should yield the weird, wonderful, deeply specific material that makes your chapter unforgettable! 🎯
