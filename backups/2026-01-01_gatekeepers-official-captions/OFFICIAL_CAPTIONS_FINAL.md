## 🎨 DRAWING 1: Eisenhower Motorola Car Phone (1956)

### Official Caption (Final)
**The Motorola Car Phone, 1956**

Eisenhower's trunk-mounted mobile telephone weighed forty-seven pounds and cost $1,400—roughly seventy percent the price of a new Chevrolet. The system operated on VHF frequencies and required a dedicated 24-volt battery because the car's electrical system couldn't handle the load. On July 26, 1956, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles used it to interrupt the President's golf game at Burning Tree with news that Nasser had nationalized the Suez Canal. The technology gave presidents an eight-year head start on the future. It also meant they could never truly escape.

### Official Caption (Final)
**Lyndon Johnson's 43-Button Console, 1965**

The Western Electric K-7000 "Presidential Console" featured forty-three direct-dial lines arranged across Johnson's Oval Office desk. Button 1 reached Lady Bird. Button 2 reached Robert McNamara. Button 47 reached Dale Malechek, his ranch foreman—because when Washington became unbearable, Johnson needed one button that connected him to something he could still control. The console told a story not just of who mattered, but of how Johnson conceived of power itself: immediacy, access, and the ability to bypass every intermediary between question and answer. The man who built the Great Society ran it like a switchboard operator who'd learned to wire his own calls.

## 🎨 DRAWING 3: Nixon Watergate Tapes (1974)

### Official Caption (Final)
**Nixon's Recording System, 1971**

Seven microphones hidden throughout the Oval Office—Shure SM33 units in the desk, Electro-Voice cardioids behind wall sconces, an Altec Lansing in the ceiling—fed Sony TC-800B reel-to-reel recorders that captured 3,700 hours of conversation. The system was voice-activated, triggered at -35 dBm, with a three-second delay to prevent gaps in the recording. Nixon wanted to preserve history. Instead, he preserved evidence. When Shure microphone #2 failed on June 23, 1972, it contributed to an 18.5-minute gap that would consume more investigative hours than any other piece of Watergate evidence. Haldeman built a system so thorough it couldn't protect even him. Every Chief since has learned the lesson: if you record the President, make damn sure the President wants to be recorded.

### Official Caption (Final)
**Reagan's STU-III Secure Phone, 1980s**

The NSA-certified STU-III (Secure Telephone Unit, third generation) weighed fourteen pounds and required thirty seconds of electronic handshaking to establish encryption before a call could begin. Reagan found it cumbersome. Baker found it essential. The solution wasn't better technology—it was better discipline. Secure calls from the STU-III, everything else face-to-face, no exceptions. Nixon had recorded everything and lost everything. Reagan recorded almost nothing and kept his presidency. The tool matters less than the discipline around its use.

## 🎨 DRAWING 5: Obama on Air Force One (2010s)

### Official Caption (Final)
**Air Force One Communications Evolution**

By the 21st century, Air Force One could stream secure video, connect to classified networks, and coordinate global military operations from 40,000 feet. The President could authorize nuclear strikes, conduct secure video conferences with field commanders, and maintain contact with the Situation Room through multiple redundant systems. There was only one thing the most connected aircraft ever built couldn't do: let the President check his email. Security protocols prohibited it. The most sophisticated communication platform in human history, and the President was still isolated. Technology improved. The isolation got worse.

## 🎨 DRAWING 6: Obama Sectera Edge Device (2008)

### GitHub Download Link
**Direct Link:** https://github.com/omarzsalah1/Gatekeepers/raw/main/06_obama_sectera_edge_pencil.png

### Official Caption (Final)
**Obama's General Dynamics Sectera Edge, 2009**

The device was not a modified BlackBerry, despite widespread reporting. It was a General Dynamics Sectera Edge SME-PED, NSA Type 1 certified for TOP SECRET/SCI communications. The camera was physically removed and replaced with epoxy. The microphone was replaced with an ultrasonic-resistant unit requiring a secure headset. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth were hardware-disabled, the modules physically removed from the circuit board. The processor was underclocked to 312 MHz for security reasons. It weighed 346 grams and cost $3,350. Obama fought for two months to keep his connectivity. What he got was a twelve-ounce reminder that being President meant being alone.

## 🎨 DRAWING 7: Trump with iPhone (2017-2021)

### GitHub Download Link
**Direct Link:** https://github.com/omarzsalah1/Gatekeepers/raw/main/07_trump_iphone_pencil.png

### Official Caption (Final)
**Trump's Unsecured iPhone, 2017-2021**

President Trump conducted the business of the most powerful office in the world on a consumer iPhone purchased at an Apple Store, protected by a four-digit PIN. The device ran iOS with known vulnerabilities, including CVE-2018-4441. The Twitter app included an unpatched SDK that exposed location metadata. The National Security Council documented at least twelve instances between 2017 and 2018 when sensitive information was discussed on potentially compromised lines. Chinese and Russian intelligence services were believed to be monitoring calls through simple interception of unencrypted commercial cellular traffic. The modified, NSA-hardened devices provided as alternatives sat largely unused. Trump found them too slow, insufficiently responsive for Twitter. Every principle of operational security, every lesson learned from decades of protecting presidential communications, was being ignored. The security community watched with horror. The solution remained elusive.

## 🎨 DRAWING 8: Biden Peloton (2021)

**Direct Link:** https://github.com/omarzsalah1/Gatekeepers/raw/main/08_biden_peloton_pencil.png

### Official Caption (Final)
**Biden's Peloton Bike+, 2021**

The Peloton Bike+ became a security crisis before Biden moved into the White House. The device featured a built-in camera, built-in microphone, and always-on internet connectivity—essentially a listening device with pedals. "Project Guardian" took three weeks: camera physically removed, microphone disabled, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth replaced with air-gapped diagnostic ports, installed in a SCIF-lite room meeting TEMPEST standards with -100 dB RF attenuation. The modification cost $12,000. Biden used it perhaps three times in the first month. The convenience of pre-loaded content couldn't replace the social features that made the platform engaging. The Peloton sat in the residence, a monument to the eternal tension: security that makes the tool useless.

## 🎨 DRAWING 9: Pneumatic Tube System (1930s-1940s)

### GitHub Download Link
**Direct Link:** https://github.com/omarzsalah1/Gatekeepers/raw/main/09_pneumatic_tube_pencil.png

### Official Caption (Final)
**The West Wing Pneumatic Tubes**

The original Lamson Engineering system installed in the 1930s once connected the Oval Office, staff offices, the mail room, and the Old Executive Office Building through four-inch brass tubes that could transport documents in under thirty seconds. The main system between the White House and OEOB was decommissioned in 1953. A small functional spur remained in the West Wing basement as late as 2018, connecting the Situation Room to a secure document prep room. Leon Panetta briefly considered using it to send burritos away from Clinton's reach. The idea died when someone pointed out that the President controlled the tube system, the Navy stewards, and the nuclear codes. You don't win a technology war with the Commander-in-Chief.

## 🎨 DRAWING 10: Nuclear Football (2017-2021)

### GitHub Download Link
**Direct Link:** https://github.com/omarzsalah1/Gatekeepers/raw/main/10_nuclear_football_pencil.png

### Official Caption (Final)
**The Nuclear Football Evolution**

Officially designated "BRIEFCASE, PRESIDENT'S EMERGENCY SATCOM, AN/URC-142(V)2," the nuclear football evolved from Kennedy's leather satchel with paper codes to a Panasonic Toughbook running a JavaScript-based STRATCOM Strategic Command and Control System. The modern version contains a General Dynamics GDC4S secure tablet, authentication via biometric-enabled CHUID smart card, and satellite communication equipment. The device inside has changed with each administration. The decision it enables—ending civilization—remains the same. The tool evolves. The weight doesn't.
