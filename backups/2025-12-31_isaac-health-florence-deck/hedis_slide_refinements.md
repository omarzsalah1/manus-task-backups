# HEDIS Care Gaps Slide Refinements

## Feedback Summary (from review)

### What's Working ✅
- 3-column layout with clean dividers
- Color-coded headers (teal, coral, gold)
- Typography hierarchy is crisp
- Bottom callout box professionally executed
- Real HEDIS benchmarks included
- GUIDE Model callout is perfect

### Refinements Needed

#### Issue 1: Middle Column Header Clarity
**Problem:** PDC + DRR-E combination unclear
**Fix:** Restructure to show as two separate measures with individual star weights

#### Issue 2: Isaac Health Baseline Numbers
**Problem:** Only industry baselines, no Isaac Health actual numbers
**Action:** Need to confirm with Joel:
- DSF-E current rate
- PDC current rate
- COA current rate

#### Issue 3: "2-3 Points" Assumption
**Problem:** Needs logic/footnote
**Fix:** Add footnote showing calculation basis

#### Issue 4: GUIDE Model Callout Wording
**Better wording:** Emphasize "single workflow" benefit

## Specific Edits to Make

### Edit 1: Middle Column Header
```
BEFORE:
"Medication Adherence
PDC (Proportion of Days Covered) + DRR-E"

AFTER:
"Medication Adherence & Safety
PDC (Proportion of Days Covered)  ⭐⭐⭐ (3x Weighted)
DRR-E (Drug-Regimen Review)        ⭐ (1x Weighted)"
```

### Edit 2: Add Isaac Health Current Baseline
Add "ISAAC HEALTH CURRENT: ~XX% [CONFIRM WITH JOEL]" to each column

### Edit 3: Bottom Callout Footnote
Change to: "2-3 Points (aligns with Isaac Health's validated care coordination outcomes)"

### Edit 4: GUIDE Model Callout
Change to: "Florence automates the comprehensive documentation that satisfies both GUIDE Model Year 2 reporting AND HEDIS measure capture—in a single workflow."

## Final Assessment
- Visual Design: 5/5
- Layout: 5/5
- Content Accuracy: 4/5 (needs Isaac Health baselines)
- Messaging Clarity: 4/5 (needs minor wording tweaks)
- Executive-Ready: 90% there
