## Slide 2: The Staggering Economic Toll of Dementia
**Headline:** Dementia Care Costs $345 Billion Annually—25% of Hospitalizations Are Preventable

**Key Data Points:**
- $345B: Total annual healthcare costs for dementia care in the United States
- $339.5B: Value of 18 billion hours of unpaid care provided by 11 million family caregivers annually
- $2.6B: Preventable Medicare spending from hospitalizations that could be avoided with proper care coordination

**Callout:** 25% of dementia hospitalizations are entirely preventable—one in four.

## Slide 3: The 99% Care Gap Crisis
**Headline:** Only 1% of 6.7 Million Dementia Patients Receive Formal Care Planning

**Key Data:**
- 6.7 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease
- 6.6 million (99%) receive fragmented, reactive care with no coordination
- ~67,000 (1%) receive formal care planning and coordination

**The Gap:** Between quarterly visits, patients deteriorate invisibly. Small problems become emergencies. Preventable conditions escalate to hospitalizations.

## Slide 4: The Independence Cliff—A One-Way Journey
**Headline:** 86% of Dementia Patients Live at Home—But Only 32.7% Return After Hospitalization

**Margaret Chen's Story:**
- Age 78, retired teacher, living alone with moderate Alzheimer's
- Daughter Linda checks in when she can between work and teenagers
- Quarterly neurology visits show stable cognition
- Between visits: UTI goes unnoticed → confusion → fall → hospitalization
- Hospital delirium causes rapid cognitive decline
- Discharge planner's verdict: "She is not going back."

**The Statistics:**
- 86% of dementia patients live in the community before hospitalization
- Only 32.7% return home after hospitalization
- 67.3% are transferred to nursing homes or institutional care

## Slide 5: The Caregiver Burden Cascade
**Headline:** When Caregivers Report "More Than I Can Handle," Hospitalization Risk Increases 8.44x

**The Cascade:**
1. Caregiver Stress Accumulates: 18 billion hours of unpaid care annually. No breaks, no support, no monitoring between visits.
2. Burden Becomes Overwhelming: Caregivers report feeling "always on duty" with no respite. Burnout leads to missed warning signs.
3. Crisis & Hospitalization: Small problems become emergencies. Preventable conditions escalate to hospital admissions.

**Research Data:**
- "More than I can handle" → 8.44x increased odds of hospitalization
- "Always on duty" → 10.67x increased odds of hospitalization

**The Solution:** Supporting the caregiver is as critical as monitoring the patient. Daily check-ins reduce burden and catch problems early.

- Escalates high-risk cases to RN/MD with full clinical context
- Documents every interaction back to the EHR via FHIR—closed loop

**For Isaac Health:**
- 40%+ readmission reduction potential
- $1.2M+ savings per ~3,000 lives (based on pilot data)
- 95%+ retention; engagement grows over time

## Slide 19: Why Isaac Health Should Act Now
**Headline:** Three Converging Pressures Create Urgency

**Quality & Value-Based Care:**
- CMS dementia care quality measures tightening
- Value-based contracts require demonstrated outcomes

**Patient & Family Expectations:**
- 85% SMS response vs. <40% answered calls
- Families expect immediate follow-up, not 48-72h delays
- Text-first outreach is table stakes for modern care

**Workforce Burnout:**
- Care managers can see 10-12 patients/day max
- Florence elevates to 100+ patients/day
- Can't hire to scale—automation is the only path
