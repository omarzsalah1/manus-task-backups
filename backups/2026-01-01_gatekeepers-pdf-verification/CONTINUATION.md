  - Compress images/drawings ONLY
  - Keep text/typography full quality

## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

### What Worked Well
1. **Compression strategy:** Clear guidance to compress images but NOT text/formatting
2. **Structured instructions:** Manus has clear, actionable requirements
3. **Success criteria:** 8 critical items + 111 total verification points
4. **Asana integration:** Task created with 4-day deadline

### What Needs Attention
1. **Cannot verify from compressed PDF:** Must always request full version first
2. **Clock-stars at 5:47:** This is THE most critical design element (narratively significant)
3. **V32 aesthetic preservation:** Aged cream background vs pure white is fundamental

### Critical Reminders
- Clock-stars showing 5:47 (not 5:45) in ALL 15 instances
- Aged cream background (#F5F0E6) not pure white
- Presidential brown text (#3D2E1F) not pure black
- Smart quotes and em-dashes throughout
- EB Garamond body, Cinzel titles, Cormorant subtitles
